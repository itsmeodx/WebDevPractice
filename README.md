# WebDev Practice

Learning Web development by actually building stuff instead of just watching tutorials.

**[Check it out live →](https://itsmeodx.github.io/WebDevPractice/)**

## What I've Built

**Portal** - A simple landing page to keep all my projects organized in one place. Way better than digging through folders to find things.

**Console App** - A JavaScript console that runs in your browser. Type some code, hit enter, and see what happens. Includes command history and a live preview panel.

## Try It Out

You can [try it live](https://itsmeodx.github.io/WebDevPractice/) or run it locally:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/itsmeodx/WebDevPractice.git
```
